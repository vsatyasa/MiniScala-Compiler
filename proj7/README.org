* Introduction

Welcome to the MiniScala project, composed of an MiniScala compiler, a virtual machine, a library and a few example programs. The directories are laid out as follows:

  - =compiler= :: contains the source code of the MiniScala compiler,

  - =vm= :: contains the source code of the MiniScala virtual machine,

  - =library= :: contains the source code of the MiniScala library,

  - =examples= :: contains a few example MiniScala programs and benchmarks.

Most of these directories contain a =README= file with further information.
